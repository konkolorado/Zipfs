This directory contains code exploring the Zipfian relationship of words
appearing in text and speech.

Some things I hope to accomplish:
1. Use a wiki-crawler to encounter and record words in various languages  
2. Display findings  
3. Generate randomly typed words to see if they follow Zipf's Law
